Hello! 
Thanks for stopping by. This repo is all about showcasing my personal projects and ones I completed as part of my intense bootcamp to help me embark on a new exciting journey into coding. Do reachout if you're looking for new talent in web dev - I'm looking for some exciting opportunities!

Each directory below showcases specific projects and each contains it's own short README file.
